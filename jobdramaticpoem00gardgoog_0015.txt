Deus intelligit viam eiuS, et ipse novit locum
illius„ Et dixit homini: Ecce timor Domini,
ipsa est sapientia, et recedere a malO, intelli-
gentia.

IOB.

Scio, quia omnes poteS, et nulla te latet cogi·
tatio. Auditu auris audivi te, nunc autem
oculus meus videt te. Idcirco ipse me repre·
hend0, et ago poenitentiam in favilla et cinere.

MULIER.

Diligam te, Domine, fortitudo mea. Laudans
invocabo Dominum, et ab inimicis meis salvus
ero.

AMICUS.

Dolores inlerni circumdederunt me: praeoc-
cupaverunt me laquei mortis

IOB.

In tribulatione mea invocavi Dominum, etad
Deum meum clamavi. Et exaudivit de templo
sancto suo vocem meam, et clamor meus in
conspectu eius introivit in aures eius

JOB

THE WOMAN.

God only understandeth what is the way
thereos, he only linoweth where is the place
thereos. And he saith unto man: L0, all wis·
dom, this it is, that thou shouldst live in lear
ol him, and to cast away all evil, is understand·
mg.

Jon. .

Ι know thou canst do all dringS, and nothing
can be withholden from thy sight. With mine
own hearing Ι heard oi thee, but now the eye of
my sight beholdeth thee. And therefore mine
own lips do condemn me and Ι am low in peni·
tence; dust and ashes cover me.

THE WOMAN.

Ι will love the Lord my God, my strength
and my redeemer. 1 will call upon him, prais-
ing him and lrom mine enemies I shall find
salvation.

THE FRIEND.

The sorrows of darkness loided me round
about: the snares and deceits oi death lastened
upon me.

Joe.

In anguish and in tribulation I have called
upon the Lord, unto God Almighty Ι cried out.
And he gave ear irom his holy temple, to my
voice he hearkened; my lamentation carne
before his presence and he opened his ears to
hear me.

Joa, me woman, nnn m amnuo.

The earth then shook and the lrame of it
trembled. On their deep foundations the hills
and the mountains swayed, and they shoolr
with iear lor the Lord was angered against
them.
