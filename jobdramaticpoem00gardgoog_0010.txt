vi

desuper, et non illustretur lumine. Maledi-
cant ei, qui maledicunt diei, qui parati ¹sunt
suscitare Leviathan. Nunc enim dormiens sile·
rem, et somno meo requiescerem cum regibus
et consulibus terrae, qui aedificant sibi solitu-
dines. Ibl impii cessaverunt a tumultu, et ibi
requieverunt fessi robore. Quare misero data
est lux, et vita bis, qui in amaritudine animae
sunt, qui exspectant mortem, et non venit?

AMICUS.

In horrore visionis nocturnae, quando solet
sopor occupare homines, pavor tenuit me, et
tremor, et omnia ossa mea perterrita sunt: et
cum spin'tus me praesente transiret, inhorru-
erunt pili camis meae. Stetit quidem, cuius non
agnoscebam vultum, imago coram oculis meis,
et vocem quasi aurae lenis audivi: Numquid
homo Dei comparatione iustificabitur? F orsi-
tan vestigia Dei comprehendes, et usque ad
perfectum Omnipotentem reperies? Excelsior
coelo est, et quid facies? profundior inferno, et
unde cognosces? Si iniquitatem, quae est in
manu tua, abstuleris a te, et non manserit in

tabernaculo tuo iniustitia, tunc levare poteris
faciem tuam absque macula, et eris stabilis, et
non timebis. Miseriae quoque oblivisceris, et
quasi aquarum, quae praeterierunt, recordaberis.
Et quasi meridianus fulgor consurget tibi ad
vesperam: et cum te consumtum putaveris,
orieris ut lucifer.

JOB

of God be never upon it, and let not his light
sbine upon it. Let them curse the day, who

curse the daylight, who are ready to mise up
Leviathan. For 1 should be in silent slumber
and deep in sleep lie resting quietly, like unto

kings and to counsellors mighty who have built χ

places desolate in solitude. There the wicked

no longer vex, and cease from troubling, and 2
there the souls that are weary lie in long slum- .
ber. Oh, why are light and life sent unto him ²

whose way is hid and whose spirit is clouded
with bitterness, who longeth for death, but it
cometh not?

THE FRIEND.

In the horror of a vision of darkness, when
the earth was deep in slumber and the night was
still, terror filled my soul with trembling, and
all my being quivered with wonder and fear.
Behold, a spirit came in presence before me,
and my flesh was cold and my beart was chill
within me. There before me saw 1 one whose
face I knew not, and the shadow of a form in
the darkness. And a voice as of a wind came
out from the darkness: How if man compare
himself to God Almighty shall he be justified?
For by man shall God and his ways be com-
prehended, and his most high perfectiori, ranst
thou in any way find it out? Higher than the
heavens is he, and what canst thou know?
Deeper than hell our Lord is, and what canst
thou understand? If thou puttest from thee
all wickedness and evil that thou holdest in
thine hand, and if thou wilt cast out from
thy dwelling-place every injustice and sin,
thou canst raise an innocent face, pure and
wholly without stain, and thou shalt fear not.
Thy misery shall be forgotten, and even as
waters that pass and return not, it shall come no
more. And brightness clear as the light of
noonday shall shine upon thee when the even-
ing falls. And when thou hast thought thy
life consumed, thou shalt shine forth like

Lucifer.
