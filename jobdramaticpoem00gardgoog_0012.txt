mentium. condemnabit te os tuum, et non
ego: et labia tua respondebunt tibi.

AMICUS.

Nonne lux impii extinguetur, nec splendebit
flamma ignis eius?

MULIER.

Lux obtenebrescet in tabemaculo illius, et
lucerna, quae super eum est, extinguetur.

MULIER rr AMICUS.

Revelabunt coeli iniquitatem eius, et terra
consurget adversus eum. Apertum erit germen
illius, detrahetur indie furoris Dei. Haec est

pars hominis impii a Deo, et hereditas verbo· .

rum eius a Domino.

CHORUS.

Quoniam, qui malignantur, exterminabuntur,
sustinentes autem Dominum: ipsi hereditabunt
terram, et delectabuntur in multitudine pacis.
Quia peccatores peribunt. Inimici vero Domini
mox ut honorificati luerint et exaltati, deficien-

tes quemadmodum fumus deficient.

IOB.

Attendite me, et obstupescite, et superponite
digitum ori vestro: et ego, quando recordatus
luere, pertimesco, et concutit carnem meam
tremor. Quare ergo impii¹ vivunt, sublevati
sunt, confirmatique divitiis? Domus eorum
mcurae sunt et pacatae, et non est virga Dei
super illos. Quis mihi tribuat, ut sim iuxta
menses pristinos secundum dieS, quibus Deus
custodiebat me, quando splendebat lucerna

evil and thou dost imitate the tongue of blas-
phemy. It is thine own mouth and not mine
that condemneth thee, yea thine own lips shall
testify against thee.

THE FRIEND.

For the light of the wicked shall perish and
the spark ol his flame shall die in darkness.

THE WOMAN.

Lightshallbeextinguishedwithinhisdwelling-
place evermore, and the candle which hangs
above his head shall not light him.

THE WOMAN kun m FRIEND.

Heeven shall lay him bare, his iniquity un-
cover, and earth shall reveal him and rise
against him. The increase of his house shall
flow away from him: in the day of God's anger
it shall be taken. This is the heritage which
the Lord appointeth unto wickedness, the por-
tion granted to wicked men.

cuorus.

Woe to them, all evil doers: they shall be
accursed; but the faithful, they that wait on

God, they shall inherit the earth, in the ways ol ,

peace they shall find abundant sweetness. But
all evildoers shall perish. He shall cast out all
his enemies; they shall vanish at the moment
when they have been raised to honorand proudly
exalted; asin smoke they shall be consumed
away.

Jon.

Now hearken to me and be astonished, and
let your finger-tips lie on your mouth lor wonder,
and mark me, when 1 do bethink me how it is,
I am learlul, my body is shaken with trembling.
Wherelore do the impious flourish, why are
they upheld, how do they come to prosperity?

Sale are their houses and free lrom barm, and
God holdeth not his rod ol wrath above them.

Who would believe it so, that but yesterday were ,
