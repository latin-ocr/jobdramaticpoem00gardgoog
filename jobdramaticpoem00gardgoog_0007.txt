ADramatin Poem sor Soli, Chorus and Orchestra, by F. S. Conversa
(Op. 24)

HE text of the poem consists of passages from the book of Job and the Psalms, grouped to

form a· short poetical unit. In the Bible story the cosmic background for Job's experiences
is the agreement between Jehovah and Satan to try the man's faith. ln the present poem the
universal order, in the midst of which Job plays his part of human suffering, rebellion, and final
submission, is represented by passages from the Psalms which express the permanence and glory
of God and his creation. The passages which comprise the text are chosen for the mood they
convey without regard to their exact place in the Bible. In the main they follow the course of the
Bible story and suggest the “ argument'' of the original, but the words of the Bible are sometimes .
put in the mouth of a different person, and in some of the musical units the words are assembled
from several parts of the Bible text.

The dramatic motive of the poem is the development of the moods of Job, distress under
suffering, rebellion, doubt, and final submissive⁰ understanding of the will of God. In emotional
contrast with him is the Woman of Israel, who represents the spirit of unquestioning faith. The
Friend stands like the three friends of the Bible story, for the spirit osconventional piety. The
chorus represents superhuman voices which declare the glory of God; against their sustained
mood of adoration and praise beats the contest of human emotions. The impersonal universal
spirit of the chorus is conveyed in the music by simple diatonic harmonies, the warp upon which
the solo parts are woven in modern chromatic design.

The poem opens with an orchestral prelude‚ which is followed with the antiphone: “ Mis
erere mihi,” sung by the Woman of Israel. A small chorus, unaccompanied, takes up the prayer.
This is answered by the full chorus in the Psalm: “ Laudate Dominum.’' Across this flood of
adoration rises Job's lament‚ in which he curses the day he was bom and longs for death. The
Friend describes in a dramatic scene a vision in which a spirit has appeared to him at night and
a voice has asked how man can compare himself to God and fathom the mysteries of the infinite.
The wisdom of God is unsearchable, and the pure and faithful shall be blessed. The Woman
and the chorus of female voices sing: “How excellent is thy name in all the earth l. . . ..What is
man that Thou art mindful of him? ”

Job tells his friend that he will expostulate with God and show that he deserves not his
afflictions. The Friend “ reproveth Job of impiety in justifying himself.'' The Woman joins the
reproof and this leads to a dramatic climax in which the full chorus proclaims the destruction of
the wicked. But Job, unreconciled, shows that the wicked do prosper and “bemoaneth himself
of his former prosperity and honor.'’ In ecstatic revery he recalls the happiness of departed
days. Toward the end of his revery the Woman and the Friend sing of the “sundry blessings
which follow them that fear God,” and the full chorus takes up the theme.

Job protests that he is not a sinful man. In defiance of his friend, and proudly confident
of his righteousness, he appeals to God to judge him.

Then ‘⁸ out of the whirlwind,” which is described in an orchestral episode, comes the voice
of Jehovah in answer to Job's appeal. With overwhelming irony—“ Where wast thou when 1 laid
the foundation of the earth? '’-the voice “convincem’' Job of the ignorance and pettiness of
human life and utters the grandeur and permanence of creation.

Job, humbled and overcome, asks, “Whence then cometh wisdom?” and the woman
answers, “Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.” Job “ submitteth himself unto God,”
and rises strong in his new wisdom. The Woman sings, “I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.'’
The Friend and Job take up the theme. The chorus chants: “Bless the Lord, O my soul.'’

The phrase, “Thou hast laid the foundations of the earth’' echoes the voice of Jehovah
in the earlier episode. Thus from Job's experience the eternity and majesty of nature is the theme
which emergesand dominates. The poem ends with the triumphant “ Laudate ’' of the opening
chorus, ’
