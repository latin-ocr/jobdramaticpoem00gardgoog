eius super caput meum, et ad lumen eius am-
bulabam in tenebris? Sicut lui in diebus
adolescentia meae, quando erat Omnipotens
mecum, et in circuitu meo pueri mei. Iustitia
indutus sum: et vestivi me, sicut vestimento et
diademate, iudicio meo. Dicebamque: In ni-
dulo meo moriar, et sicut palma multiplicabo

dies.

MULIER.

Beati omnes, qui timent Dominum, qui am-
bulant in viis eius.

IOB.

Radix mea aperta est secus aquas, et ros
morabitur in messione mea.

AMICUS.

Labores manuum tuarum quia manducabis.

CHORUS.

Beatus es, et bene tibi erit. Uxor tua, sicut
vitis abundans, in lateribus domus tuae. Ecce,
sic benedicetur homo, qui timet Dominum.

IOB.

Quis mihi tribuat auditorem, ut desiderium
meum audiat Omnipotens, Per singulos gradus
meos pronuntiabo illum, et quasi principii
offeram eum.

JOB

ix

the old days, the months departed, when the
Lord held me in his mighty hand, days when
the flame of his splendor spread its brightness
all about me, and beneath his light I walked in
safety through the darkness? Even so my
way was lighted through all the days oi my
ripencss‚ when the Lord in his mercy was with
me and in a circle my children gathered about
me. In righteousness I wrapped myself, I had
clothed me with the robe oi justice, it wasa
diadem, a garment about me. Then I said: I
shall die in the nest that shelters me, and like
the palm tree number my days full many.

THE WOMAN.

Blessed‚ thrice blessed, are they who fear the
Lord, who follow in his ways forever.

Jos.

Then my roots were uncovered beside the
waters, and dew from night to morning lay
upon my branches

THE FRIEND.

For what thine hands produce by labor thou
shalt consume it.

CHORUS.

And blessed be, thou shalt be called happy.
For beside thee as a vine that is laden, shall the
wile ol thino house be fruitlul. Lo, how that
man shall be blessed who walketh in the fear ol

Jos.

Oh, would that there were one who should
hear me, oh, my desire is great that thou shouldst
hear my prayer, Almighty God. And I will
declare my reasons yea, one by one pronounce
them, and as to a prince will I come before thee.
